I am currently a Research Scientist in the Meta Reality Labs. Before Meta, I received a Ph.D. degree in the department of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University, a B.E. degree in engineering physics from Tsinghua University in 2015. My primary area of research has been temporal modelling, image generation, and novel view synthesis.
